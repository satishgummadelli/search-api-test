The purpose of this exercise is to produce a piece of code that meets professional standards to be used as a conversation piece in the interview. Please bear in mind that these are the minimum requirements and that the exercise is intentionally open-ended.
Task
Create a web-service that searches a configured directory, including subdirectories, for files containing all words in a list of words that are provided to the service via an HTTP call.
•	Present a simple RESTful API to allow a search to be performed.
•	Allow searching with multiple words.
•	Multiple word searches should return only files that match all words (AND search).
•	Should perform whole word matches.
i.e. A search for ‘Cat’ should not match the word ‘Scatter’.
•	No fuzzy search required.
No need to worry about wildcards, stemming, substring matches etc.
•	Return results as quickly as possible.
•	Your code should be production ready code, and up to a professional standard.

Assumptions
You can assume the following are true.
•	Files and their content won’t change between calls to the service, nor will files be added or removed.
•	You have all the memory
